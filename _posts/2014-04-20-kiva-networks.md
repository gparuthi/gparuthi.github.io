   This study looks at how the lender network of Kiva based on the team membership correlates with the fulfillment of loans and the outcomes of the fulfilled loans. In particular, we are interested in predicting (1) how soon a loan is funded, as well as (2) whether the loan gets funded by the deadline.

<p class="c5"><span class="c1">Microfinance is of critical value as a source of financial services for entrepreneurs and small businesses lacking access to banking and related services.</span><span class="c18 c35">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Created in October 2005 as the first peer-to-peer microlending site, www.kiva.org(Kiva) is a platform for low-income entrepreneurs in developing countries to fundraise for their business from other individuals. Through Kiva, anyone can make an interest-free loan of at least $25. </span><span class="c1 c28">As of Nov. 2013, Kiva was able to raise about $1 million every three days</span><span class="c1">. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Here is how Kiva works. After the initial screening, a</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;potential borrower will build an online profile on the Kiva website. A lender will the pick a business and make a loan using their credit card. </span><span class="c1">Then Kiva transfers the loan to the local partners, and partners disburse the loan to local borrowers. P</span><span class="c1">artners will then collect the revenues from borrowers and pay the loans back to the lenders again through Kiva. Previous researchers have investigated how the characteristics of borrowers and lenders influence funding behaviors. For instance, </span><span class="c1">Meer &amp; Rigbi (2013) found that whether to fund a loan or not depends on the language barriers and social distance. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">In August 2008, Kiva created &ldquo;Lending Teams&rdquo;. Kiva lenders can voluntarily &nbsp;join and organize their own teams. Kiva teams cover a broad range of themes a</span><span class="c1">nd interests. </span><span class="c1">Team members can communicate through team messages in team forums (Figure 1). Each loan made by the members is counted towards team contribution to Kiva borrowers. Teams are ranked according to the team contribution. The team feature makes Kiva lenders more motivated to participate in lending activities because of the team identity. The team ranking also may foster competitions among different Kiva teams. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c2"></span></p><p class="c5 c15"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 510.19px; height: 322.50px;"><img alt="QQ20140420-2.png" src="/images/kiva-networks/image08.png" style="width: 510.19px; height: 322.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c5 c15"><span class="c26 c18">Fig 1. Snapshot of a Kiva team page</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Research shows that the team features has an impact on funding behaviors. For instance, Liu et al. (2012) found that one makes more loans after joining a team. Chen et al. (2012) further explored the causal effects of team forum messages on nudging team members&rsquo; lending decisions. By manipulating the message contents in Kiva team board, they found that forum messages increase lending from team members. Messages with social information about coordination and competition encouraged more team lending.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Drawing on the previous literature about the effects of Kiva teams on lending behaviors and outcomes, this study looks at how the lender network of Kiva based on the team membership correlates with the fulfillment of loans and the outcomes of the fulfilled loans. In particular, we are interested in how lender network structures correlates with (1) how soon a loan is funded, as well as (2) whether the loan gets funded by the deadline.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c11"></span></p>
