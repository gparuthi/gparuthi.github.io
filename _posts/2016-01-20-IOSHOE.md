    An experimental swarm light installation exploring a network for collective action.
---

In this work in progress, we designed and built low-power connected shoelaces for exploring network of collective action in swarm light installations. The work is a collaboration between [DoIIIT](http://doiiit.github.io/) and [assocreation](http://assocreation.com/). My role was specifically in designing and building the makerspace version of the device.
