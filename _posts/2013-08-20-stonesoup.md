Community displays facilitate interaction and increase awareness in collocated communities. In this work, we designed and developed a community driven proactive display system that detects the nearby users and allow its users to personalize content for the display. We have used findings from existing literature to create a community display system that is well-suited for an existing student community. Moreover, we expand the design space for proactive community displays to reduce the burden of updating content, provide greater realtime control, and allow greater exploration of community content and community members.
