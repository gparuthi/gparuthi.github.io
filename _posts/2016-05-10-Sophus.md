Sophus is a mobile application that helps users get their questions answered by the local community. It is a location-based question & answer platform that crowdsources answers and displays the most relevant questions for users based on their interests, background, and location. Our objective is to leverage local expertise to help users get trustworthy answers from others who live in similar environments and have been through similar experiences. Our mobile application, through focusing on the ‘local’ and the ‘community’, aims to become a one-stop app that users can utilize to get answers and also answer questions about navigating day-to-day life in their immediate surroundings.
